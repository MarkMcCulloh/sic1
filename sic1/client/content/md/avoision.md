To help improve morale, SIC Systems has provided an officially sanctioned computer video game called "Avoision" for employees to play. If you think your work would benefit from an entertaining diversion, please feel free to compete against your coworkers for the highest score in "Avoision" (during your two legally-mandated unpaid breaks, or in lieu of an unneeded bathroom break).

### Instructions
Use the arrow keys or WASD to move your bright green block and try to capture the bright green square. The faster you capture the square, the more points you will score.

As you progress, moving dark green blocks will appear. If your bright green block collides with a dark green block, the game is over.

Click the "Play Avoision" button below to play.
