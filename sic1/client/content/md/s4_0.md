Hey, {{self.name}}! How's it feel to be a full-time employee working on the cutting edge of revolutionary technology? Only a single instruction! Amazing!

Anyway, I did see your question about the compensation package Mary provided to you. I apologize if the pay is lower than what you were expecting. Another HR mix-up! What can I say?

I'll talk to Rick to see if we can make an exception and raise your pay immediately, but just keep in mind that this company has a lot of room to grow, so your hard efforts will be very well rewarded!
