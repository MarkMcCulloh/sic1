Hi, {{self.name}}, I'm {{from.name}}. We met in the hallway earlier.

Is there any chance you could come over to my cubicle and help me with the first assessment? I'd ask Feng for help, but I haven't seen him around yet this morning.

Yesterday, Feng mentioned something about just using a label that initially points to the value zero, but what does that even mean??? He also said something about being able to reset a variable back to zero by subtracting itself. Is that a thing? I'm so lost!

Thanks for your time!
